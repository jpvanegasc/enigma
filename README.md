# ðŸ¤– enigma

`enigma` is a simple programming language designed for defining and running Turing
machines in a human-readable format. It allows users to easily specify states,
transitions, and initial tape contents to simulate computational logic.

Enigma is built using several crates that handle different parts of the logic:

- [turing](crates/turing) handles the simulation of the Turing machine itself.
